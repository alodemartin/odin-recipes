    <h4 style="color: #7e0306"> Ingredients </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 kilo of beef slaughter</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>2 carrots</li>
        <li>1 bunch of parsley</li>
        <li>1 red pepper</li>
        <li>100 grams of grated cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground chili</li>
        <li>1 handful of coarse salt</li>
        <li>1 vegetable broth cube</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style="color: #7e0306"> Steps </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>To start with our recipe, we first prepare 
            all the ingredients. We stretch the matambre 
            to remove the fat. With a sharp blade, we 
            remove all the fat from the matambre. </li>
        <li>Before starting to prepare, we cook 4 eggs 
            for 10 minutes and set them aside. We roast 
            the red pepper to peel it more easily. Chop 
            the parsley and finely grate the carrot. Cut 
            the red pepper into wide strips. We do all 
            this to later fill the matambre.</li>
        <li>Now that we have all the ingredients ready, 
            we begin to prepare our Argentine stuffed 
            matambre. Season and sprinkle the matambre 
            with oregano, ground chili, chopped parsley, 
            carrot and grated cheese. To finish the 
            filling, we distribute the red chili strips 
            over it and place the hard-boiled eggs at the 
            widest end of the matambre.</li>
        <li>We begin to roll the homemade matambre. 
            Bending the two ends inward so that the eggs 
            do not escape and, pressing firmly, we finish 
            the procedure. We tie with a cotton thread to 
            maintain the shape.</li>
        <li>Place plenty of water in a large pot with a 
            handful of coarse salt and a vegetable broth 
            cube. Once the broth starts to boil, we cook 
            the rolled matambre stuffed with vegetables 
            over medium heat for approximately 1 hour. 
            When it has finished cooking, we turn off the 
            heat and let it cool in the broth.</li>
        <li>
            Then, we remove it and press it for at least 
            5 or 6 hours. We put it in the refrigerator 
            for at least 1 hour before consuming it. 
            Enjoy it!</li>
    </ol>
