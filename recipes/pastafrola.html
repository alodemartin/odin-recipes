                Pasta frola, or pastafrola, is a traditional cake 
                decorated with strips of dough and filled with 
                sweets. Depending on where it is prepared, the 
                filling may vary, but the most common in 
                Argentina is the traditional quince pastafrola.

    <h4> Ingredients </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of flour</li>
        <li>1 cup of sugar (200 grams)</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>100 grams of butter</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 pinch of lemon zest</li>
        <li>400 grams of quince paste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4> Steps </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the sugar with the butter in a bowl at 
            room temperature. Then, add the eggs one by 
            one and add the flour, vanilla essence and 
            lemon or orange zest little by little.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture onto a floured surface and 
            knead until you obtain a soft dough. Let the 
            traditional pastafrola dough rest in the 
            refrigerator for approximately 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>After the resting time, remove the dough from 
            the refrigerator and let it come to room 
            temperature. Then, grease and sprinkle a 
            baking pan with flour. Spread the dough with 
            your fingers, making the base for the easy 
            homemade frola pasta.</li>
        <li>Cut the quince paste into small pieces and 
            mash it with a little hot water or sweet wine 
            until it softens completely. In this step you 
            can use a potato masher or heat it a little 
            to achieve the desired texture.</li>
        <li>Add the quince to the frola pasta dough base 
            that you have already prepared, spread it well 
            everywhere and cover it with strips of dough 
            to decorate.</li>
        <li>
            Finally, bake the pasta frola with quince 
            recipe at an average temperature of 180ÂºC for 
            about 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
