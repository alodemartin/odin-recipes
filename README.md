# odin-recipes

Hello everyone, I am taking my first steps in the world of web development, 
therefore I am going to present this project that will be in constant evolution: 
a site dedicated to sharing Argentine recipes. 
As a newbie to the art of design and coding, this project is more of a simple 
platform to practice and hone my web development skills.
